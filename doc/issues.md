# Problem
yy yanks the newline when copying a single line.
This makes inserting a line into another a little bothersome

- use 0Y to copy the line instead of yy if there is just one line
- Use lua to edit the register and remove the last line \n under some conditions (paste in visual and insert mode)

# Get Block_indent() working properly

# Change autocomplete from <c-n> to tab; keep <c-n> for movement within a autocomplete list
