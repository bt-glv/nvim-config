# To-Start
- Get github copilot working
- Switch to Packer.vim? Maybe? What I did with this config basically transformed Plug into Packer..
- Install a patched font (nedfonts hack)
- Fix that LUA lsp problem on my nixos installation
    - more about it (3rd answer): https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75880481/cant-use-lua-lsp-in-neovim
    - perhaps find a way to use system-installed lsp servers together with mason?
    - perhaps switching to the nixos unstable branch might fix it?

# In-progress
- Try and configure surround.vim

# Done
- Try nvim tree
- Try oil.vim
- Get lsp working
- Fix my colorscheme
- Find a better remap for <c-w>
