# To-Start
- Switch to Packer.vim? Maybe? What I did with this config basically transformed Plug into Packer..
- Install a patched font (nedfonts hack)
- Fix that LUA lsp problem on my nixos installation
    - more about it (3rd answer): https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75880481/cant-use-lua-lsp-in-neovim
    - perhaps find a way to use system-installed lsp servers together with mason?
    - perhaps switching to the nixos unstable branch might fix it?
- Experiment using VimWiki instead of notion

# In-progress
- Enable copilot automatically if a lsp is active for the current buffer. Do this by either creating a autocmd or hooking a function to a lsp-config event.

# Done
- Try FireNvim 
- Get github copilot working
- Install flash
- Install leap
- Try and configure surround.vim
- Alt + space for esc... maybe?
- Try nvim tree
- Try oil.vim
- Get lsp working
- Fix my colorscheme
- Find a better remap for <c-w>
- Change 8 space indenting to 4 or 3 space indenting
