# To-Start
- Switch to Packer.vim? Maybe? What I did with this config basically transformed Plug into Packer..
- Fix that LUA lsp problem on my nixos installation
    - more about it (3rd answer): https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75880481/cant-use-lua-lsp-in-neovim
    - perhaps find a way to use system-installed lsp servers together with mason?
    - perhaps switching to the nixos unstable branch might fix it?
- Experiment using VimWiki instead of Obsidian
- Find a way of adding a github copilot chat window

# In-progress
- Install and experiment with undo-tree
- Install a patched font (nedfonts hack) and that icons plugin
- Install and experiment with vim-fugitive and gitsigns.nvim

# Done
- Install and try Harpoon
- Enable copilot automatically if a lsp is active for the current buffer. Do this by either creating a autocmd or hooking a function to a lsp-config event.
- Try FireNvim 
- Get github copilot working
- Install flash
- Install leap
- Try and configure surround.vim
- Alt + space for esc... maybe?
